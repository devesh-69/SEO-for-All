# SEO for All

This repository is a structured SEO learning and demonstration space built to explain **how search engines interpret websites** — technically, structurally, and behaviorally.

It combines **visual HTML-based demonstrations** with **SEO frameworks, tools logic, and decision-making principles** used in real-world SEO work.
